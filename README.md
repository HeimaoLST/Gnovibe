## Why I created this repo

This repository aims to improve my programming skills without relying on "vibe coding" or an AI agent's help. Of course, I still use Claude to review my code, which helps find bugs and improve code quality.

## Introduction to the Repo

`.Claude/review.md` is the prompt that CC (Claude Code) uses to generate a review to help you.
The `project/` directory contains the projects I am implementing. You can also follow my journey to improve yourself.
